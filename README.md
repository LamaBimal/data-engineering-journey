# Data Engineering Journey 🚀  
**Year: 2026**

## 📌 Purpose
This repository documents my **12-month focused journey (2026)** to become **excellent in one core technical skill: Data Engineering**.

The goal is to move from a general IT background to **production-level data engineering expertise**, with strong foundations in:
- SQL
- Python
- Data Modeling
- Big Data (Spark)
- Workflow Orchestration (Airflow)
- Cloud (AWS)
- End-to-End Data Pipelines

This repo is **learning by building**, not just theory.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Objectives
- Become a **job-ready Data Engineer** (Germany / EU friendly profile)
- Build **real, explainable systems**
- Develop **depth, not scattered knowledge**
- Keep the door open for **research / PhD** in the future

---

## ⏱️ Time Commitment
- **1–2 hours per day**
- **5 days per week**
- Consistent weekly progress throughout 2026

---

## 🗺️ 2026 Roadmap (High Level)

### 🔹 Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1–12 | Jan–Mar 2026)
**Focus:** Core skills and thinking like a data engineer

- Advanced SQL (joins, CTEs, window functions, optimization)
- Python for data processing (Pandas, clean code, error handling)
- Data modeling (OLTP vs OLAP, star schema)

📁 Output:
- SQL scripts
- Python ETL scripts
- Data model diagrams and notes

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Big Data & Orchestration (Weeks 13–24 | Apr–Jun 2026)
**Focus:** Scalable data processing and pipeline orchestration

- Apache Spark (DataFrames, transformations, performance basics)
- Apache Airflow (DAGs, scheduling, retries, monitoring)

📁 Output:
- Spark ETL jobs
- Airflow DAGs with documentation

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Cloud & End-to-End Project (Weeks 25–40 | Jul–Oct 2026)
**Focus:** Real-world system design and deployment

- AWS fundamentals (S3, IAM, EC2, Glue, Athena/Redshift)
- One **end-to-end analytics data platform**

📁 Project includes:
- Data ingestion
- Cloud storage
- Distributed processing
- Orchestration
- Data modeling
- Analytical queries
- Architecture diagram
- Full README

This project is the **centerpiece** of the repository.

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Polish & Market Readiness (Weeks 41–52 | Nov–Dec 2026)
**Focus:** Professional readiness

- Code refactoring & documentation
- Interview preparation (SQL, Spark, Airflow, system design)
- CV, GitHub, and job applications (Germany / EU)
